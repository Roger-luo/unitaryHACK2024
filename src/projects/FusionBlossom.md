The fastest MWPM decoder in the world. It demonstrated decoding a 1000-qubit surface code at a rate of a million measurement rounds per second when running on 32-core CPUs. For more details see our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/yuewuo/fusion-blossom) and [our paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10313859). It also comes with a nice visualization tool implemented with Vue.js and Three.js.
